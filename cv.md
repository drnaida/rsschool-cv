## Self-presentation

My goal in the nearest half of the year is to **get a job as Junior Developer at EPAM** or other IT companies. I have been studying web-developing for 1.5 years. Recently I made a landing page and business card website using CSS/JS/HTML5 and SASS.

I believe to be a skilled programmer you have to learn fast the latest technologies. As for me, **I would like to learn** JS libraries such as **React, study Node.js and Webpack, know more about SEO**. I feel quite comfortable speaking/reading/listening to English, that's why **I'm looking forward to working in international teams**. 

I appreciate that in the last years of school I studied homeschooling (without teachers and an obligation to pass homework and exams). **It taught me time-management, having priorities and learning from every source I could.** But the greatest thing, **studying more things** than are in-school program **began being my main hobbies**.

## English
I have been seriously studying English in total for 3 years.

My current level is **Intermediate**. I talk with my teacher in English and visit special speaking clubs every day. That's why I think **my speaking skill is great.** In addition, I studied grammar course and **I'm good at listening**. I can watch from serials on Netflix to lectures from Harvard and Yale. 

My language goals are **to achieve the Upper-Intermediate** and **pass TOEFL**.
